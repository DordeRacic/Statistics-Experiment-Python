# Statistics-Experiment-Python

DESCRIPTION: This is a simple project focusing on solving an experiment in my statistics class. I opted to do it this way instead of the traditional pen and paper way since I saw the data on the website and though that I should scrape it. Then I decided to sharpen my data analytics skills and explore the data and make the necessary calculations.

Tehnically, first you would look at Scrapey.py and then PandaReading.py . table_data.csv is what is scraped into a coma seperated value (CSV) file. In PandaReading.py we turn it into a dataFrame with pandas and explore it with numpy, matplotlib and seaborne.

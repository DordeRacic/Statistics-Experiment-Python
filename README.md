# Statistics-Experiment-Python

DESCRIPTION: This is a simple project focusing on solving an experiment in my statistics class. I opted to do it this way instead of the traditional pen and paper way since I saw the data on the website and though that I should scrape it. Then I decided to sharpen my data analytics skills and explore the data and make the necessary calculations.
